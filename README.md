# warriorcats
This project is a sort of warrior cats-themed simulator/generator fangame. It's purpose is for the player to be able to name their own 
warrior cats clan and pick randomly generated cats to inhabit it, and then watch over the clan as it grows and develops.
Later I'm hoping to also make it possible to create and customize the cats from scratch yourself.
